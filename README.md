# myOS operating system
myOS is a fully functional custom built x86 based operating system made entirely in nasm assembly and C. This OS implements the FAT file system.
This OS currently utilizes a 512 byte bootloader.

## Requirements
I made this OS in Ubuntu so you need to install nasm and mtools. Other dependancies may vary depending on your distro.
